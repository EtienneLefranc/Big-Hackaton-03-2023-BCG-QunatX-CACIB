# BIG QC-AI-HPC Hackathon by Quantx - March 2022

Dear participants,

The BIG QC-AI-HPC Hackathon by QuantX, the first-of-a-kind competition, aims to gather the whole value chain of Artificial Intelligence, Quantum and High Performance Computing to demonstrate the ability of hybrid technology to address real-life challenges. During the event, the business world, represented by industrial and financial companies, VC/PE investors, and consulting groups, will join forces with the scientific computing specialists from academia, leading quantum providers, and HPC centres to approach a set of longstanding problems from different domains: chemistry, machine learning, optimization, numerical simulations, to name a few. Through establishing a stage for collaborative problem solving, the BIG QC-AI-HPC Hackathon will help the participants to investigate the real impact of their work, todayâ€™s viability of hybrid solutions, existing business interest, and efforts to be done in the coming years.

The BIG QC-AI-HPC Hackathon is organized under the high patronage of Neil Abroug - <em> the Head of the French National Quantum Strategy </em>. It is supported by <b>PRACE</b> - the Partnership for Advance Computing in Europe, <b>GENCI</b> - the French research infrastructure in charge of implementing national policy in HPC, AI and QC, <b>Boston Consulting Group</b> - a global consulting firm that partners with leaders in business and society to tackle their most important challenges, and <b>Le Lab Quantique</b> - the Paris-based think tank and network of bottom-up initiatives promoting quantum technologies.
